# Increase history size
export HISTFILE=~/.zsh_history  # History file location
export HISTSIZE=100000      # Number of commands stored in memory
export SAVEHIST=100000      # Number of commands saved to file

# Critical History Options:
# These ensure history is saved correctly and shared across sessions.
setopt APPEND_HISTORY      # Append to history file, don't overwrite
setopt SHARE_HISTORY       # Share history among all open Zsh sessions
setopt INC_APPEND_HISTORY  # Add new commands to history file as they are typed (very important for real-time sharing)
setopt EXTENDED_HISTORY    # Record start and end timestamps of commands

# Other useful history options (optional, but recommended for cleaner history):
setopt HIST_EXPIRE_DUPS_FIRST # Expire duplicates first when history exceeds limit
setopt HIST_IGNORE_DUPS    # Don't record command if it was just recorded
setopt HIST_IGNORE_SPACE   # Don't record lines starting with a space (e.g., ` history`)
setopt HIST_NO_STORE       # Don't store the `history` command itself in history
setopt HIST_REDUCE_BLANKS  # Remove extra blanks from history lines
